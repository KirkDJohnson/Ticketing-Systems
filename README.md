The first ticketing system that I will explore is spiceworks's Cloud Helpdesk tool. The ticket viewing page is very clean and there are ample settings within the organization that I can customize.<br/>

I first begun by just working my way through the different settings and experimenting with the different tools and functions of the ticketing system such as: creating users, ticket rules, ticket categories, and creating a canned response for helpdesk to input when closing a ticket to improve efficency. <br/>

<br />
<br />
I now began to test creating tickets in different ways. Within the ticketing system, you (acting as the admin or a manager can manually create tickets. This would likely happen if instead of a user creating a ticket through the portal or email, they call helpdesk and IT support and we fill out a ticket for them. Within the ticket, I input the contact or name of user that the ticket belongs to, the summary, description of the probelm, assigned it the manager Mr. Mercury, gave it a priority and category. However, if the user provided screenshots or pictures of the issue, they could have also been included here.<br/>

<br />
<br />
Another function of cloud help desk that I found interesting and useful was the article page that is shown next to where a user what submit a ticket. This is useful because if there an influx of a specific kind of ticket, in my exmaple I chose that users were sending tickets about their outlook mailbox becoming full preventing them from sending and receiving tickets, I made a user friendly article detailing easy solutions for the users to take without needed to submitting a ticket and therefore reducing the number of tickets to help desk and giving users freedom.<br/>
